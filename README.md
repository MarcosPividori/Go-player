Go-player
=========

- To play against the program using a friendly graphical user interface, you should install Gogui from: http://gogui.sourceforge.net/
- Once you have installed Gogui, you can compile this project and attach "marcos_go" binary, in order to play against it. Also you can test it playing against other Go players, such as GnuGo. For this, you can use the Gogui graphical interface or the command gogui-twogtp. You can see an example on the script: "generate_stats.py".
